title: "What They See Is What They Will Be"
speaker: Vincent Sanders
event: CascadiaJS 2019
tags: ["Culture", "Inclusivity"]
abstract: "I believe that building more inclusive tech communities begins with the youth. What they see is what theyâ€™ll be. Dedicating time to the youth will not only open their eyes to a future in tech, but it will help existing members of the tech community to understand their privilege."
