title: "Complex Geometry in HTML! A story of Constrained Creativity"
speaker: Pantelis Kalogiros
event: CascadiaJS 2020
tags: ["CSS","3-D","Perf"]
abstract: "We have all seen rotating cubes and used transformZ(0) for some quick boost in performance. But what else are 3d transforms good for? Let's see how we can construct complex geometry, and build a full first person game rendered entirely in html/css and js! Pushing the limits of what a technology is supposed to do, can unlock a world of creativity and out of the box thinking."
