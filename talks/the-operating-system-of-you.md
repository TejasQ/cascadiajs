title: "The Operating System of You"
speaker: Shawn Wang
event: CascadiaJS 2020
tags: ["Career","Coding"]
abstract: "Developers are mostly humans that run the same \"hardware\". Therefore most performance differences, especially the ones we can control, are down to our \"OS\" - our conscious prioritization and processing - and \"firmware\" - our unconscious personality and reactions. What can we do to better take care of our \"hardware\", and what does running better \"software\" look like?"
