title: "The Future of the Web"
speaker: Mikeal Rogers
event: CascadiaJS 2018
tags: ["web", "p2p"]
abstract: "The original vision of the Internet was for a fully decentralized system that empowered its users at the edges. In the many years since the birth of The Web weâ€™ve moved more towards centralized structures to solve the issues of scale and data and it has not come without consequence. In order to move past these issues we need new primitives for a new vision of The Web that can be decentralized."
