abstract: "The evolution of user interactivity on the web has birthed the growing advancements of web innovation and creativity. Pushing developers and designers to look for unique ways to engage and immerse our users. From utilizing AR in online retail to show what products would physically look like either in a living space or on the users themselves, to banking in VR where low-poly animations are used to teach money management. Let's explore available VR tools, from A-Frame and beyond, and different use cases for developing in VR for the web."
