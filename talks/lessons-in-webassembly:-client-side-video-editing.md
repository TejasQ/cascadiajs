title: "Lessons in WebAssembly: Client Side Video Editing"
speaker: Megan Slater
event: CascadiaJS 2018
tags: ["web assembly", "video", "react.js"]
abstract: "WebAssembly elicits hopes about everything from importing new functionalities into browser based applications, to the potential (and in some circles hoped for) death of JavaScript. This talk is for folks who are curious about the real world applications and limitations of WebAssembly as it exists today. We'll follow along the journey of some intrepid developers as they integrate the popular FFmpeg multimedia framework into a React application for the purposes of editing video client side."
