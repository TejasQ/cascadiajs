abstract: "We're pretty used to drones flying around us by now. Until now most of these drones were still controlled by a human operator. But what if we could control them solely using our code? In this talk I will show how to control multiple drones using JavaScript. With the help of Node.js we'll send commands to the drones and read back their telemetry. I will talk about the difficulties of flying and keeping control of a drone completely without human interference. At the end we will actually have a small swarm of drones flying on stage!"
