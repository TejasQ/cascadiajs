tags: ["Dependency Management"]

abstract: "Choosing a JavaScript library is a lot like dating: the longer you commit yourself, the messier it is when you decide to break up.  Whether something better comes along, or the library is deprecated, changing a dependency often requires a lot of time or leaves the code in a less attractive state. In this talk you will learn some techniques that will help ease the pain of this situation."
