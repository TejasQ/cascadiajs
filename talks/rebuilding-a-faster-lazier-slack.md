abstract: "A new version of Slack is rolling out for our desktop customers, built from the ground up to be faster, more efficient, and easier to work on. In this talk, Iâ€™ll focus on our move from an eager data model to a lazily loaded and incomplete data model, and how that made for a speedier Slack experience."
