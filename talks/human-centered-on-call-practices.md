title: Human Centered On-Call Practices
speaker: Najla Elmachtoub
event: CascadiaJS 2020
tags: ["DevOps", "Mental Health"]
abstract: "In a \"move fast and break things!\" world, what happens when the things we’re breaking are our people and teams? In this talk, we’ll walk through a real example of my team’s on-call process, where alarm and burnout became the norm in the midst of revenue-driven deadlines. We’ll discuss how taking a human-centered and data-driven approach to resolve this process debt resulted in a happier team and more robust software, and how this framework can be applied more generally."
