title: "How To Be a Web AV Artist"
speaker: Ruth John
event: CascadiaJS 2018
tags: ["Web MIDI", "Web Audio", "Data Visualization"]
abstract: "Come and be fascinated by the world of audio visualisation in a browser. This isnâ€™t just about creating stunning data vis to music! We see how we can pipe data realtime into custom properties to enhance our visuals. Ruth will re-address how we analyse sound via the Web Audio API and proposes a better way of processing the data to better suit music. And, to top it all off, we harness the Web MIDI API for full hardware control as well. You may not think it, but this really is a talk with a great deal of take-aways and new techniques for you to consider in your coding life."
