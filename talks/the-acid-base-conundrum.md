title: "The ACID/BASE Conundrum"
speaker: Sangeetha KP
event: CascadiaJS 2020
tags: ["Databases"]
abstract: "When we start a new project, we are often posed with the task of setting up a data store. The arises the inevitable question \"Should I use a SQL based store or NOSQL one\". We might tend to lean towards SQL due to it's familiarity and ubiquity; or lean towards NoSQL due to its ease and low setup cost. In this talk, we will look at database choices through a different lens. Taking inspiration from CAP theorem we will understand the ACID/BASE properties of datatbases that will act as guiding principles for choosing database."
