title: Understanding accessibility as a Concept
speaker: Jemima Abu
event: CascadiaJS 2020
tags: ["accessibility"]
abstract: "Knowing how to build accessible products is important but it's just as important to know why we build products to be accessible. Basic human decency aside, there's a plethora of reasons for building products that everyone can use. In this talk, we'll explore the concept of accessibility in order to better understand its necessity and the ramifications involved in building non accessible products. We'll also answer pressing questions like \"How do I know if this thing I built is accessible?\" and \"Whose job is it to ensure accessibility?\" (Spoiler: it's everyone's job)"
