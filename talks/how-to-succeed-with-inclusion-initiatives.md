title: "How to Succeed with Inclusion Initiatives"
speaker: Ginger Chien
event: CascadiaJS 2019
tags: ["Culture", "Inclusivity"]
abstract: "Leadership and staff must take intentional, self-aware personal risks to steer workplace culture toward inclusion and its economic benefits. This requires permission and a moral directive from the top to create space, incentivizing management to role model vulnerable and remarkable behaviors, giving employees opportunities to participate in and create their own inclusion activities that involve discovery and testing of personal comfort zones, and to openly reward successes."
