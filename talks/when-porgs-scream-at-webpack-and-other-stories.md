abstract: "For many web developers the world of hardware is very intimidating. There is no easy way to go back from a broken to a working project state. You break something, you replace it â€” there is no Ctrl/Cmd + z. However, getting a project to work is incredibly fun and rewarding. In this talk we'll be talking about different ways you can use your JavaScript knowledge to build your own hardware projects."
