title: Saving Data to the DWeb
speaker: Kelsey Breseman
event: CascadiaJS 2020
tags: ["dweb", "IPFS", "dat"]
abstract: "The Environmental Data & Governance Initiative monitors how the state presents (or fails to present) environmental data to the public. This is the perspective from which we approach the decentralized web: public ownership of public data. In this beginner-friendly talk, we walk through each step in the technical process of uploading data into IPFS and Dat: how it works, and how it's important to stewardship of critical data."
