title: "The Bizarro Web: Where SPAs are Scarce."
speaker: Kyle Jacobson
event: CascadiaJS 2019
tags: ["spa", "web standards"]
abstract: "Now's a good time to turn a critical eye toward our single page app assumptions.\nThe evolution of the web was never on an inevitable path; it was a loosely-coordinated series of decisions by standards-making bodies, browser makers, and developers that could have gone very differently. It still can."
