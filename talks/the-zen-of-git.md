title: "The Zen of Git"
speaker: Tianyu Pu
event: CascadiaJS 2020
tags: ["git"]
abstract: "Git is a version control system that's widely used and often misunderstood. Is it possible to really understand how it works, and maybe, just maybe, enjoy using it? This talk is for anyone who has used Git before and would like to learn more about how it actually works. I plan to talk about the internals of Git, including how objects are stored, and how things like branches and tags fit into this representation. With this foundation, I also want to deep-dive and examine how commonly used commands (like git reset, git checkout, git merge and git rebase, among many others) can be understood in terms of what has already been covered in the talk."
