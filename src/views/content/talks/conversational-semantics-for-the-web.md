title: "Conversational Semantics for the Web"
speaker: Aaron Gustafson
event: CascadiaJS 2018
tags: ["semantic web", "voice"]
abstract: "Over time, your users will become more accustomed to and reliant on voice-based interactions with their computers and, thereby, the web. Enabling them to complete critical tasks without a visual user interface will be crucial for the long-term success of your website. In this session, Aaron Gustafson will discuss how smart markup choices can improve the overall usability and accessibility of your projects without disrupting your current workflow."
