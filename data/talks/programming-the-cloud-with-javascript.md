title: "Programming the Cloud with JavaScript"
speaker: Christian Nunciato
event: CascadiaJS 2019
tags: ["cloud", "javascript", "infrastructure"]
abstract: "We've come a _long_ way with JavaScript --- and yet the range of what we can do with this language only seems to keep expanding. In this talk, I'll share a little about how I came to care about infrastructure as code, then show how we can use JavaScript to create not just our beloved front-end apps and services, but also the cloud infrastructure we need to bring them out into the world."
