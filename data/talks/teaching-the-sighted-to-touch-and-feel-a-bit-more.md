speaker: Faddah Wolf
event: CascadiaJS 2018
tags: ["accessibility", "react.js", "react native"]
abstract: "Braille is becoming more and more ubiquitous in many common spaces â€” airports, malls, libraries, etc. A college in Oregon needed an App built to help teach the friends & family of those who are sight impaired how to read Braille. Faddah Wolf will go over what accessibility options there are in common Mobile OS's, how he created a React Native six-key-input keyboard for Braille and how you can contribute to this Open Source project."
