Let's take some time to tackle these topics and level up 📈your CS skillset! This workshop will be a gentle introduction suitable for devs of all backgrounds. 🧑‍🍳 

We will start with very basic JS objects like ```{ value: 42 }```, and build progressively to create (from scratch!) Linked 🔗Lists, Stacks 📚and Queues ♻️.

So whether you are in a job hunt or just hunting for ways to be better at your job, join us for a workshop full of FUNdamental concepts that unlock new developer capabilities. You'll leave with your own repo of data structures you'll understand, because you'll have coded them yourself.
