In the [Intro to Data Structures](./intro-data-structures) session, we started from scratch and learned how to build Linked Lists, Stacks and Queues using pure JavaScript. 

Now we're going to spend the afternoon building up from there to master Binary Trees ðŸŒ´ and k-ary Trees, and Hash Tables ðŸ§©. 

So whether you are in a job hunt or just hunting for ways to be better at your job, join us for a workshop full of FUNdamental concepts that unlock new developer capabilities. You'll leave with your own repo of data structures you'll understand, because you'll have coded them yourself.
