Choo! Choo! All aboard the Hacker Train! If you live in Portland, OR or Vancouver, BC there is **no better way** to get to CascadiaJS than to join your fellow devs on the Hacker Train. Ditch the car, make some friends and fork repos on the train Wi-Fi as you head to Seattle. The Hacker Train drops off in downtown Seattle and is a short taxi or ride share to our official [partner hotels](/2024/hotels).

## How does it work?

Find your city below and book your ticket. That's it! 

We'll make sure to promote this particular departure date and time, so that everyone departing from your city will be on the same train. We'll have a Train Captain in each city that will help coordinate the fun and hand out some goodies to folks from our sponsors.

NOTE: the routes below are just the ones that get you TO Seattle on June 19, so please don't forget to book your return trip based on your schedule!
