## Directions to the Conference

We strongly encourage folks to take public transportation to the conference and to arrive as early as possible. Town Hall Seattle is located in downtown Seattle and the traffic is pretty awful during the work week. 

Here is a link to [transit and parking information](https://townhallseattle.org/plan-your-visit/location-directions-parking/) for the venue.



## Dinner Options

We have blocked off time in between the end of the conference and the beginning of the Closing Party for attendees to get dinner in Seattle and make their way to Optimism Brewing. There are a dozens great places to eat in between the conference venue and the party, so have fun exploring!
