"Something is broken": are hopefully words you never have to hear from your users. Even worse is when you don’t know how to fix that “something”. Join this workshop to learn how to make sure users are heard, alerts are alerting, and priorities are prioritized. Spend your dev cycles more on new features and less on digging through logs, trying to figure out how to repro an issue, or guessing what part of your codebase is the culprit. 

## Prerequisites

Knowledge of how to build a web application.

## Agenda

- Explore a set of common web app issues
- Understand why they can be difficult to solve
- Break developer challenges into categories:
  - User perspective is lacking
  - No clear debuggable path
  - Hours wasted on tasks better suited for a computer
- Deconstruct distributed tracing
- Discover ways to make debugging faster
