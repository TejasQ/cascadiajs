Following the talks on Day Two, we're putting on our 2nd annual Startup Fair! [Last year's event](https://2022.cascadiajs.com/conference/startup-fair) was amazing and we can't wait to run it again this year with an emphasis on AI. 

This event will take place on the evening of June 21st and run from 6pm - 9pm. The purpose of the Startup Fair is to showcase early stage startup building the next generation of AI and developer tools to our community.

If you're a founder and you'd like to exhibit, all you need to do it apply. The application process is easy, just tell us a little bit about your company and what you're building. Applications will be accepted on a rolling basis and will either close on <span class="highlight warning">Friday, May 3</span> or once we hit our cap of 5 startups, so please don't delay. Startups who are invited to participate in the Startup Fair will recieve:
