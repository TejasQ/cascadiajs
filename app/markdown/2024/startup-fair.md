Following the talks on Day Two, we're putting on our 2nd annual Startup Fair! [The 2022 event](https://2022.cascadiajs.com/conference/startup-fair) was amazing and we can't wait to run it again this year with an emphasis on AI. 

This event will take place on the evening of June 21st and run from 6pm - 9pm. The purpose of the Startup Fair is to showcase early stage startup building the next generation of AI and developer tools to our community.

We invited early-stage startups to apply, and after several rounds of review we are excited to announce the startups that will be exhibiting!
