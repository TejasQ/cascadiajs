CascadiaJS exists to educate and grow the JavaScript community in the Pacific Northwest. We're constantly seeking new ways to make our community broader and more inclusive, so we're excited to work with our community to fund this year's Opportunity Scholarship Program.

## Requirements

The Opportunity Scholarship Program is open to anyone who:

```
1. Lives in the Pacific Northwest

2. Is able to attend both days of the conference (June 20 and June 21)

3. Meets -one- of the following:

    a. Is a member of an under-represented minority (URM) in tech

    b. Has financial constraints that make purchasing a ticket a blocker
```
